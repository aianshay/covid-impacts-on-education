Project for the Specialization and Residence in Engineering and Data Science at the Centro de Inform√°tica - Universidade Federal de Pernambuco/Samsung

In this project, we analyzed the school performance and the school dropout rate for elementary and high school students in Brazil before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also developed an exploratory data analysis to answer our seven research questions to refute or corroborate the raised hypotheses. In our results, we showed that there was a significant impact of the pandemic on the school performance and school dropout rate of elementary and high school students in Brazil.
